# Character and IP publication policy

Generic character selection, state-machine and rendering capabilities can be public. A concrete character and its assets require a separate publication decision.

- New and unreviewed assets default to confidential. Public release requires recorded approval for specific files and versions.
- Review covers names, character registration/defaults, source portraits, animation clips, derived images, prompts, examples, test fixtures, documentation, screenshots and installer contents.
- Do not copy internal catalogues, character identifiers, approval discussions or private media links into a public repository or PR.
- Public builds must register only approved public assets. An empty character library is valid; do not insert an unreviewed sample to fill it.
- New outfits, animations and other derivatives inherit the source asset's classification until separately reviewed.
- Review the exact outgoing commits and their reachable history, not just the current working tree. Hiding a UI entry, adding an ignore rule, or deleting a file at the branch tip does not remove historical content.
- Work from public ancestry. Never publish a private branch after deleting its private files. Inspect the resulting source and release artifact before distribution.

This policy does not change runtime behavior or add bundled characters. A checklist is not a technical guarantee against every accidental publication; maintainers must also run their approved asset audit and review the results.

## Approved default media

On 2026-10-19, the project owner explicitly approved the following exact versions for inclusion in public `v1.0.0dev` source. The integration preserves these files unchanged. This records source publication approval; it does not initiate a push, package release or deployment. New derivatives require separate review.

The mobile pet avatar asset added on 2026-10-27 is a byte-identical copy of the approved `nova_orb_avatar.png` above, registered as the Flutter default avatar and recorded here without re-encoding. It introduces no new character, outfit or animation, so the 2026-10-19 approval continues to cover these exact bytes. Users may replace the avatar locally with their own photo; that local file is never bundled, uploaded or synced.

The owner also explicitly approved the following five UI regression screenshots on 2026-10-19. They contain generic controls and synthetic test copy, with no character media or organization data.

## Generic UI screenshot review (2026-10-24)

For the requested v1.0.0dev integration push, the following widget-test screenshots were visually reviewed. They contain generic controls and synthetic test text, with no character media or organization data. This is source screenshot review, not physical-device acceptance. The approved character media above remain byte-for-byte unchanged.

## UI polish screenshots (2026-10-27, pending owner review)

The UI review polish merges the approved Nova avatar with the "Nova" app-bar title, removes the separate body avatar, and adds a pet-avatar settings sheet plus a "Pet avatar" settings row. The following widget-test goldens were regenerated from the same synthetic fixtures with the documented `flutter test --update-goldens` mechanism. They now contain the approved character media recorded above (no new character, outfit, animation or derivative) plus generic controls and synthetic copy, with no organization data. These exact versions are **pending the project owner's screenshot review** before any push that includes them; the previously reviewed versions remain listed above for history.

`chat-tasks.png` also reflects the Tasks-tab restyle (Tasks/Schedules segmented control, Today/Earlier sections and session-duration labels) added in the same polish pass; the fixture text is still synthetic and no character or organization data was added.

`chat-home-empty.png` and `workbench-nova.png` share a hash because both capture the same empty Nova chat screen. `chat-task-draft.png` matches the 2026-10-19 approved version again: the task chat has no pet avatar in its app bar, and the old body avatar is gone. The pet avatar photo library permission string in `clients/flutter/ios/Runner/Info.plist` is generic; user-chosen photos stay in the app-support directory and are never bundled or synced.
