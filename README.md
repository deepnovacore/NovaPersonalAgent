**An open-source personal agent with private memory, smart proactivity and realtime interaction.**

Nova draws on your context and private memory to understand what matters to you. It knows how and when to clarify, ask for approval, and move work forward. Its dual brains keep the conversation responsive while background agents handle longer tasks. Refine your goals as work progresses, revisit the results, and stay in control.

## 1. Highlights

[![Nova personal agent architecture](assets/architecture/nova-personal-agent.en.png)](assets/architecture/nova-personal-agent.en.png)

Your context informs the conversation; the front brain coordinates work with the back brain. Nova checks results and speaks when it matters.

- **Your proactive personal agent.** Timeline, Ideas, Goals, Feeds and Profile turn what Nova knows about you into suggestions you can act on.
- **Wide and unstructured context.** Bring folders, mail, calendars, conversations and documents; keep personal memory traceable, editable and removable.
- **Always-on voice assistant with dual brains.** The front brain stays in conversation while the back brain handles long-running work.
- **A thin frontend task coordinator.** Clarify, authorize and delegate to a coding agent; check evidence against your criteria, take over and hand control back.
- **Restrained proactivity.** Nova chooses what matters and when to speak. Routine updates stay quiet, and reminders respect your turn.

- **More coding agents.** New sessions can also run on OpenCode, CodeBuddy, Pi or DeepSeek Harness over ACP; each session keeps the agent it started with. Live steering stays a Codex feature. See [Coding](docs/en/executors/coding.md).

## 2. Work with Nova

### 2.1 Your personal agent, with wide and unstructured context

Connect the sources you choose: folders, mail, calendars and conversations. Personal memory and imported document knowledge help Nova understand your work; reading sources and model processing remain separate permissions.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
      <h3>Your personal workbench</h3>

### 2.2 Your voice assistant with restrained proactivity

The front brain handles conversation; the back brain does the work. Task events and camera observations inform optional updates, while speaking has its own timing.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
      <h3>Understands what you mean</h3>
      <p>Describe your goal naturally. Nova asks for missing details before starting a task; keep talking and refining it while the back brain works.</p>

    </td>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
      <h3>You set the boundaries</h3>
      <p>Nova coordinates tasks and checks results against your criteria. Review permissions, take over when needed, and hear updates when they matter.</p>

## 3. Quickstart

### 3.1 Install and run

**Quick downloads · v0.4.0** — [Release notes and SHA-256 checksums](https://github.com/deepnovacore/NovaPersonalAgent/releases/tag/v0.4.0) · [Latest release](https://github.com/deepnovacore/NovaPersonalAgent/releases/latest)

| Platform | Download |
| --- | --- |
| macOS · Apple Silicon (arm64) | [DMG](https://github.com/deepnovacore/NovaPersonalAgent/releases/download/v0.4.0/nova-personal-agent-0.4.0-macos-arm64.dmg) · [ZIP](https://github.com/deepnovacore/NovaPersonalAgent/releases/download/v0.4.0/nova-personal-agent-0.4.0-macos-arm64-app.zip) |
| Windows · x64 | [EXE](https://github.com/deepnovacore/NovaPersonalAgent/releases/download/v0.4.0/nova-personal-agent-0.4.0-windows-x64.exe) · [Portable ZIP](https://github.com/deepnovacore/NovaPersonalAgent/releases/download/v0.4.0/nova-personal-agent-0.4.0-windows-x64-portable.zip) |
| Linux · Ubuntu 22.04+ x64 | [AppImage](https://github.com/deepnovacore/NovaPersonalAgent/releases/download/v0.4.0/nova-personal-agent-0.4.0-linux-x64.AppImage) · [DEB](https://github.com/deepnovacore/NovaPersonalAgent/releases/download/v0.4.0/nova-personal-agent-0.4.0-linux-x64.deb) |

Requirements: Node.js 22.13+ and npm. For coding tasks, install and authenticate your chosen coding backend; Codex uses its app-server transport.

Install the release with npm.

```bash
npm install --global nova-personal-agent@latest
# open the shipped app; configure a provider to enable voice
novapersonal
# open the settings panel in the app
novapersonal config
# list the keys your voice pipeline needs; --online tests them
novapersonal doctor
```

v0.4 introduces the Nova Personal Agent package names. Published v0.3.x versions retain the old package names and `novaaudio` command. The new package keeps that command alias and reuses existing data and settings. When migrating an existing global install, first run `npm uninstall --global nova-audio-agent nova-audio-agent-server` to avoid command-link collisions; this leaves user data intact.


Quit Nova before upgrading, then rerun the install command above. To pin a version, use `nova-personal-agent@0.4.0`. Upgrades keep your settings and data. State files are versioned, so an older build may refuse a newer file; run `novapersonal reset-state` (after backing up) before downgrading.

Headless Ubuntu 22.04+ x64:

1. Install or upgrade with `npm install --global nova-personal-agent-server@latest`, then configure the service and initialize credentials using the [configuration guide](docs/en/deployment/remote-server.md).
2. Start the service with `novapersonal-server start`.
3. In a second terminal, run `novapersonal-server pair wss://your-host.ts.net` to display a one-use pairing QR code.

### 3.2 Develop from source

For development from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepnovacore/NovaPersonalAgent.git nova-personal-agent
cd nova-personal-agent
npm ci && cp .env.example .env
```

Get an API key from [DashScope](https://platform.qianwenai.com) and set `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`. That one key runs voice, memory, the camera and web search. Search goes through Bailian until you add a [Tavily](https://docs.tavily.com) `TAVILY_API_KEY`.

```bash
npm run start:client
# Open Workbench for this launch, overriding the saved startup preference
npm run start:workbench
# Build, diagnose or run the local demos
npm run build --workspace @nova-personal-agent/runtime
node runtime/dist/src/cli.js diagnose --json
node runtime/dist/src/cli.js demo all
```

The client includes microphone, camera, sound, settings and external MCP controls. Try hovering over the desktop orb for a surprise :)

## 5. Roadmap

- [x] **v0.4.0 — Ongoing context and specialist agents.** Persistent home and Timeline, scheduled tasks, incremental Profile updates and multiple coding backends. GUI/device execution remains experimental.
- [ ] **v1.0.0 — Stable release.** Establish stable core behavior across supported platforms, reliable installation and upgrades, predictable recovery, and complete user documentation.

Development integrations are not release guarantees. Features ship after their supported configurations pass acceptance.

## 6. Contribution

```bash
npm ci && npm run check && npm run build && npm test
```

Live integrations are credential- and hardware-dependent and never substitute for the
deterministic tests. Security reports: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md); contribution rules and
invariants: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
